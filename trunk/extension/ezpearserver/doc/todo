TO DO:
======


InstallSide
~~~~~~~~~~~

PHASE 1:
--------

. pear role (php script) that will install a pear-repackaged ezp package
  => test it with a real eZP package file
  => test it with php 5.1 / pear 1.4.1

. bundle it as pear package itself: OK

. distribute it via share.ez.no pear channel

. prepare pear package of full ezp: OK

. investigate potential usage of 'pear uninstall' command to uninstall package

. investigate usage of 'pear upgrade' command to upgrade package (custom tasks get the last version nr)



PHASE 2:
--------

. investigate usage of file-task / postinstall script instead of file-role
  => waiting for answers from pear's mailing lists

. investigate more advanced use of roles/tasks to bypass the package-in-package limitation and use a real pear zipped package

. investigate usage of ezc for creating pear package tgz instead of "pear package ezpublishXXX.xml" command: verify time, mem usage differences

. fix: when building an ezp package, ezpearinstaller is not a requirement

. investigate usage of signed packages

. admin GUI to browse pear servers


ServerSide
~~~~~~~~~~

PHASE 1:
--------
. implement channelname() tpl operator (allows an ini value to override SiteURL) ?
  - needed when creating a package via cli and want to deploy it standalone

. in templates, urlencode in links all things that might contain spaces

. instructions to add apache redirect (or ez internal redirect) for /channel.xml => /pear/channel.xml

. implement REST api (using views) ...

. content classes (or ezpersistentopbjects? => use 2 separate handlers for retrieving stuff...) used to define packages/categories/versions

PHASE 2:
--------
. html views besides the rest views (q: shall we implement this instead in a client extension such as ezextensioninstaller?)
. conversion scripts from ez package xmls to pear xmls (integrate in ezextensionbuilder?)

PHASE 3:
--------
. implement REST api using ggws/ezrest instead of views/templates ?

. implement xmlrpc API? (see http://pear.php.net/manual/en/guide.migrating.channels.xmlrpcfunctions.php)
  note: it is deprecated by PEAR itself, so...
